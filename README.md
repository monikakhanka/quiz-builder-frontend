# Quiz Builder App

A full-featured quiz builder and viewer built with **Next.js**, **Material UI**, and **@dnd-kit** for drag-and-drop.  
The project allows you to create, edit, reorder, and publish quizzes — all stored locally in `localStorage` with the help of **axios-mock-adapter** for API mocking.
